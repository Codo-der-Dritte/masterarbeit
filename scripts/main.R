# Title: Stock Flow Consistent Model

# Purpose : This script serves to run all function that are written
#           and then stored in the folder R. These functions also 
#           include function for data cleaning and processing.
#           The script should use as little as possible of own code.
#           Everything should be reproducible every time the R is 
#           restarted. These main results regarding data and the model
#           are then saved. Outputs are created in a different script
#           which should be more flexiable and versatile.
